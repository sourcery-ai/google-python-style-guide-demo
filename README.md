Demo repository using Sourcery to enforce the Google Python Style Guide

## Integrations

### Pre-commit

The file [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) configures [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run the [Sourcery pre-commit hook](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Guides/Getting-Started/Command-Line/#pre-commit-hook).

Make sure you have [pre-commit installed](https://pre-commit.com/#install) together with its [git hook scripts](https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts). The first time the Sourcery pre-commit hook is executed, you will be prompted to log in to Sourcery if you are not already logged in. Please follow the [login instructions from our docs](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Guides/Getting-Started/Command-Line/#login) to get Sourcery set up and ready to work with pre-commit!
